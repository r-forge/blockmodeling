plotMat and all functions calling it (plot.* methods for results of critFunC, optParC and optRandomParC) now plot the lines separating sets/modes of units (if clu is a list) with different color (red) and twice as wide as regular lines. 
Also several spelling errors corrected in plotMat and co documentation and comments.

Date: 2022-07-25
A bug fix related to exchangeClusters.

Version: 1.1.1.9000
Date: 2022-07-25
Added option to fix some clusters (they are not "optimized" but fixed as they are) + some minor changes (new unlistClu function) and documentation improvements.

Version: 1.1.0.9005
Date: 2022-07-01
Some bugs fixed. Some changes to code made to eliminate NOTEs in Rcheck

Version: 1.1.0.9004
Date: 2022-05-20
Some bugs in binary stochastic (homogeneity) generalized blockmodeling fixed.
Some updates to documentation.

Version: 1.1.0.9003
Date: 2022-05-19
Binary stochastic (homogeneity) generalized blockmodeling should be fully supported (testing needed).

Version: 1.1.0.9002
Date: 2022-05-11
Added support for row/column-dominant blocks for binary and valued blockmodeling.

Version: 1.1.0.9001
Date: 2022-05-05
Started adding support for stochastic (homogeneity) generalized blockmodeling.

Version: 1.0.10
Date: 2022-04-01
A bug in plotMat corrected that caused -Inf "labels"  being plotted instead of values in some cases.

Version: 1.0.9
Date: 2022-03-23
A bug in funByBlocks corrected. The function did not officially support multi-relational netowrks, but actually they were supproted, while it was expected that thay were represented with an array, where the first dimmension represented the relation. No this was changed so that the last/third relation represents the relation as it is implemented in in most other functions, e.g. in critFunC and optRandomParC.

Version: 1.0.8
Date: 2022-02-24
A line added to print.optMorePar to print a line with the number of solutions with the same error.
A printed message in optRandomParC corrected (the number of solutions with minimal error).
"tests" directory added with currently only one file. The plan is to add some tests here, possibly also some automatic. 

2021
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 2021-10-21
A bug in plotMat when using parameter MplotValues (introduced in version 1.0.6) fixed.

Date: 2021-09-22
An option added to use load-balancing or ordinary parLapply. A bug fixed that could in some cases (when parLapplyLB was used and no random functions were used on the master) lead to an error that ".Random.seed" is not found. A parameter useRegParrallaBackend was added so that already registered parallel backend is only used if explicitly asked for.

Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2021-09-17
Changed default parallel backend to foreach --> default is now useParLapply = FALSE. cl argument is now taken into account also if foreach is used.
plotMat was given an additional parameter MplotValues, where a character matrix of the same dimensions as x/M can be supplied, which values are then printed in cells instead of the values of M.

Date: 2021-08-27
A "NOTE" in cran checked fixed - no longer existing web page.

Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2021-07-26
Added function for printing of results of optRandomParC.
Added function for ordering a partition and an option to order a partition before plotting with plotMat or using it in funByBlocks.

Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2021-07-20
A bug fixed so that the value of switch.names in optRandomParC should be now set correctly by defaults. This makes sure that in cases where blockmodel is not pre-specified we do not get solutions that differ only in the order of groups.
Also, functions for findind canonical partition and unique canonical partitions were added. 

Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2021-06-01
Utility functions added. Relative fit function added.

Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2021-03-24
Utility functions added.

Date: 2021-02-01
plot.array removed - only goes by name plotArray.
Minor bug fixes.

June 9, 2020
Version 0.3.8
Added helpfile for baker data in an R package (see R/data.r).

June 7, 2020

2019
March 27, 2019
Version 0.3.5
Changed the default value of the paramter justChange in optPar(C) to TRUE. This speeds up the optimization. Previously it was set to FALSE so that tests could be made if the faster option gives the same/correct results.

2018
December 24, 2018
Added two arguments into optRandomParC (approaches and blocks). Also the description of these arguments was added into optRandomParC.Rd file

Bug fixed in critFunC.

November 7, 2018
Version 0.3.3
Corrected documentation on critFunC and optParC in the part on using argument "approaches". Also, the functions were updated so that "ss" and "ad" are accepted as values of the approaches argument (which was previously documented, but not supported).
Function EM that extract the error matrix was added.

Updated help files (e.g. helpfile for function optParC was inserted (combined) in help file of function critFunC).
Added new functions plotMat, plotArray and plotMatNm which are equivalent to the old functions plot.mat, plot.array and plot.mat.nm. The old functions will eventually be replaced with the new functions.

Merged optParMultiC and optParC in to optParC.
