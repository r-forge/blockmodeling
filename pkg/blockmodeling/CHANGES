Title: Generalized and Classical Blockmodeling of Valued Networks


2022
Version: 1.0.8
Date: 2022-02-24
A line added to print.optMorePar to print a line with the number of solutions with the same error.
A printed message in optRandomParC corrected (the number of solutions with minimal error).
"tests" directory added with currently only one file. The plan is to add some tests here, possibly also some automatic. 

2021
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 2021-10-21
A bug in plotMat when using parameter MplotValues (introduced in version 1.0.6) fixed.

Date: 2021-09-22
An option added to use load-balancing or ordinary parLapply. A bug fixed that could in some cases (when parLapplyLB was used and no random functions were used on the master) lead to an error that ".Random.seed" is not found. A parameter useRegParrallaBackend was added so that already registered parallel backend is only used if explicitly asked for.

Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2021-09-17
Changed default parallel backend to foreach --> default is now useParLapply = FALSE. cl argument is now taken into account also if foreach is used.
plotMat was given an additional parameter MplotValues, where a character matrix of the same dimensions as x/M can be supplied, which values are then printed in cells instead of the values of M.

Date: 2021-08-27
A "NOTE" in cran checked fixed - no longer existing web page.

Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2021-07-26
Added function for printing of results of optRandomParC.
Added function for ordering a partition and an option to order a partition before plotting with plotMat or using it in funByBlocks.

Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2021-07-20
A bug fixed so that the value of switch.names in optRandomParC should be now set correctly by defaults. This makes sure that in cases where blockmodel is not pre-specified we do not get solutions that differ only in the order of groups.
Also, functions for findind canonical partition and unique canonical partitions were added. 

Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2021-06-01
Utility functions added. Relative fit function added.

Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2021-03-24
Utility functions added.

Date: 2021-02-01
plot.array removed - only goes by name plotArray.
Minor bug fixes.

2020
August 1, 2020
Version 1.0.1
Various bugs fixed.

July 1, 2020
Version 1.0.0
Modified optRandomParC so that packages doRng, doParallel and foreach are not loaded unless explicitly requested.

June 9, 2020
Version 0.3.8
Added helpfile for baker data in an R package (see R/data.r).

June 7, 2020
Version 0.3.7
Added baker data in an R package (see data  folder).

May 27, 2020
Version 0.3.6
Moved to Roxygen2 for generating NAMESPACE and help files. Moved to parLapplyLB {parallel} as primary way of parallel execution.

January 28, 2020
Version 0.3.6
Changed DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE as packages doRng, doParallel and foreach were moved to suggests (from Depends). To comply with CRAN rules as doRng was oprhaned.

2019
March 27, 2019
Version 0.3.5
Changed the default value of the paramter justChange in optPar(C) to TRUE. This speeds up the optimization. Previously it was set to FALSE so that tests could be made if the faster option gives the same/correct results.

2018
December 24, 2018
Added two arguments into optRandomParC (approaches and blocks). Also the description of these arguments was added into optRandomParC.Rd file

November 9, 2018
Version 0.3.4
Bug fixed in critFunC.

November 7, 2018
Version 0.3.3
Corrected documentation on critFunC and optParC in the part on using argument "approaches". Also, the functions were updated so that "ss" and "ad" are accepted as values of the approaches argument (which was previously documented, but not supported).
Function EM that extract the error matrix was added.

November 5, 2018
Version 0.3.3
Some minor bug fixes, performance improvements and documentation improvements.

September 3, 2018
Version 0.3.2
Edited grammar in help files.
Several bug fixes in plotting functions.

May 29, 2018
Version 0.3.1
Edited grammar in help files.
Editing style (APA) of citaitons of blockmodeling package in publications.
Added a reference for the method in the 'Description' field. 

April 25, 2018
Version 0.3.1
A bug fix which prevented the use of functions gplot1 and gplot2.

April 10, 2018
Version 0.3.0
Final tweaks before submission to CRAN.

March 28, 2018
Correcting some FORTRAN warnings.

March 2, 2018
Version 0.2.4
Added help files for functions optRandomParC and critFunC.
Updated help files (e.g. helpfile for function optParC was inserted (combined) in help file of function critFunC).
Added new functions plotMat, plotArray and plotMatNm which are equivalent to the old functions plot.mat, plot.array and plot.mat.nm. The old functions will eventually be replaced with the new functions.


2017
December 8, 2017
Version: 0.2.3
Merged optParMultiC and optParC in to optParC. 
Added formating to returned clu from these functions.

June 30, 2017
Seveal bug fixes.


2014
May 14, 2014
Version: 0.2.2
A bug in sedist fixed.

Several improvements, added additional block types (rfn, cfn, cdo, rdo) and support for multilevel blockmodeling.

2012
November 15, 2012
Version: 0.2.2
Added posibility to differentially weight relations, block type and positions or based on specially designed weights.
Added additional block types in C the blocks are now limited to: "nul", "com", "reg", "cre", "rre","dnc"
Multicore support through package doParallel for function optRandomParC.

February 9, 2012
Version: 0.2.1
Added optParMultiC - function for searching whole neighbourhood before moving to the next partition.
Added valued blockmodeling in C (the blocks are still limited to nul, com and reg).
